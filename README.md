## Data Source

Dataset has been provided by Crisp Academy ,here is the dataset for adventure work [Click Here](https://github.com/Zaki1203/Adventure-Works-Sales-Dashboard/blob/main/AdventureWorks%2BRaw%2BData.zip)

## Tools

I've utlized microsoft powerbi for data cleaning using power query and creating interactive dashboard

## Data Preparation

First, unzip the folder and open Power BI. Select the folder containing the sales data and load it into Power BI by choosing the appropriate folder column. Click on 'Combine and Load' to import the data. Subsequently, load the remaining tables one by one. Once the data is loaded, perform a data type inspection for each column, Do basic data cleaning removing duplicates,unnessary columns and add new measure columns

## Data Modelling 

Once our data is Prepared we will do Data modelling
